## Introduction
A temperature converter facilitates the conversion of temperature measurements between different units such as Celsius and Fahrenheit. This project aims to create a user-friendly Fahrenheit to Celsius and Celsius to Fahrenheit converter, utilizing a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.

## Abstract
The purpose of this project is to develop a temperature converter that allows users to input temperature values using a keyboard and view the converted results through a GUI template.

## References
This project is referenced from the book "Java The Complete Reference Eleventh Edition" by Herbert Schildt, as well as various online resources and tutorials on GUI development.

## Future Development
- **Unit Conversion:** Extend the program to support additional temperature units like Kelvin or Rankine.
- **Conversion History:** Implement a feature to display a history of previous conversions made by the user during the current session.
- **GUI Enhancement:** Add more GUI components and features for improved user interaction.

## Conclusion
The Temperature Converter project provides a simple yet useful application for converting temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Developed using Java and Swing library, it offers a user-friendly interface with text fields and buttons for input and output. The program concludes by setting the frame visible for user interaction.
